# üìö *ContraDictionary*üîç

A surprise, two-day hackathon for General Assembly‚Äôs Software Engineering Immersive course. 

### The Team:

* Aislin Bamber -  [GitHub](https://github.com/aislinb) 
* Sandra Spighel -  [GitHub](https://github.com/hotsauceninja) 

### Deployment

This website was deployed using Netlify and is available  [here](https://reimagined2020.herokuapp.com/) . 

### Brief 

In pairs, we were required to build a React.js application, which consumed a public API, and displayed it on a custom front-end. 

*Requirements:* 
* *Consume a public API* ‚Äì this could be anything but it must make sense for your project
* *Have several components* - At least one classical and one functional
* *The app should include a router* - with several ‚Äúpages‚Äù
* *Include wireframes* - that you designed before building the app
* *Be deployed online* and accessible to the public

### Technologies We Used
* *APIs*:
	*  [Google Dictionary API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI)  
	*   [Urban Dictionary API](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary) ,
* *Front-end*:
	* CSS3 + SASS
	* HTML5
	* JavaScript (ES6)
	* React.js
	
* *Dependencies*:
	* Axios
	* react-router-dom
	* yarn

* *Development Tools*:
	* Eslint
	* Git + GitHub
	* Google Fonts
	* Heroku
	* Insomnia
	* VS Code

### How To Install
1. Clone the project from GitHub onto your machine.
2. Use `yarn` or `npm` to install dependencies from the package.json file.
3. Start the server:  `yarn start`.

### Concept

In our pair we researched which public APIs were available for us to use for no cost and, more importantly, provided clear documentation of how to implement them. Whilst Googling around we saw that there were quite a few options for dictionaries, also falling upon the Urban Dictionary API. This lead us to the idea of comparing the two side-by-side in a simple, and clean-looking single-page application, with one search field returning results from two APIs, providing the user with the traditional and slang definitions. 

Many of the APIs required a long-winded authorisation process in order to be issued with the keys be able to use them, so we decided upon the Google Dictionary for both simplicity and speed.

### Planning

We developed quick wireframe sketches of how the application would look to present to our instructor for sign-off, and moved on quickly to most tricky part which was working with our APIs.

We were required to sign up to Rapid API for the Urban Dictionary API usage rights in order to retrieve the secret key.

After creating our front-end we therefore created an .env file in which to store this, and set about fetching our data using Axios:

```
const baseUrlUrbanDictionary = 'https://mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com/define'

export function getUrbanDictionaryDefinition(wordSearched) {
  return axios({
    method: 'GET',
    url: baseUrlUrbanDictionary,
    params: { term: wordSearched },
    headers: {
      'x-rapidapi-key': process.env.REACT_APP_MY_URBAN_API_KEY,
      'x-rapidapi-host': 'mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com',
    },
  })
}

```

The structure of the Classic Dictionary‚Äôs API was slightly harder and it took us a while to get the definitions we required onto the page, as its structure required us to map through the meanings and then the definitions within those meanings, as below:

```
function ClassicWordDefinition({  phonetics, meanings }) {
  return (
    <>    
      <div className="dictionary-content">
        <h2 id="title-font"> &nbsp; <em>{phonetics[0].text}</em></h2>
        <div className="definitions">
          {meanings.length > 0 ? 
            meanings.map((meaning, index) => (
              <div key={index}>
                <em>{meaning.partOfSpeech} &nbsp; :</em>
                <div><br/></div>
                {meaning.definitions.map(definition => (
                  <div key={definition.definition}>
                    {definition.definition}
                    <div><br/></div>
                    {definition.example ?
                      (<div> Example: {definition.example} </div>) 
                      :
                      <div></div>}
                    <div><br/></div>
                    <div>***</div>
                  </div>
                ))}
                <div><br/></div>
              </div>
            ))
            :
            <div>
              <br></br><i>We are cheapskates so the free dictionary that we are accessing does not have an entry for this word üò≠ </i>
            </div>
          }
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
export default ClassicWordDefinition

```

### Insomnia 
Insomnia was a new tool for us but it quickly became invaluable in working out the bits of data we wanted to use, how nested those were, and how many fields we wanted to render on the page.

### Wins
* Teamwork:
This was our first experience with pair-coding which was a real adjustment  in terms of how I was used to troubleshooting.  We had great communication so were able to adapt the pace to each others needs as and when it was required.
* We made sure we shared the work by taking it in turns to code using the screen share function on Zoom 
*  It was also excellent practice in trying to keep our syntax uniform, using the same naming convention styles, etc., and also being able to explain our thought processes and the logic behind our code when working through problems
* Refactoring - I was very pleased with how we kept code simple and easy to read, by organising into a few smaller components. 
* MVP - we kept the Minimum Viable Product simple and clean, as we wanted to really concentrate on consolidating the knowledge we‚Äôd gained throughout the previous week and get to grips with React and manipulating data. I think this worked really well - we delivered a completed product that was aligned with the brief and had decent styling too - and playing it safe built much needed confidence at this tiring stage in the course!

### Challenges
* We wasted a fair bit of time at the beginning of the project searching for appropriate APIs
* I‚Äôd say this was still a valuable lesson as it just required us to problem solve and find answers for ourselves
